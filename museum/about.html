      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>Established in 1950, the museum started as a modest collection of local historical artifacts. Over the decades, it has grown into a world-renowned institution housing over 50,000 items, including archaeological finds, artworks, manuscripts, and multimedia exhibits.</p>
      <p>Major milestones include the opening of the International Art Wing in 1975, the launch of our Digital Archives in 2005, and a complete renovation of the gallery space in 2020 to include interactive and accessible design features.</p>
      <p>Today, our museum serves as a hub for global scholarship and community learning, with visiting scholars, rotating exhibitions, and educational events year-round.</p>
      <p>The museum’s architecture itself is a marvel, blending classical design with modern sustainability practices. Guided architectural tours are available to highlight its unique features.</p>
